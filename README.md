## Usage

The Periodic Table React.js Project is a static representation of the periodic table of elements. To navigate and explore the table, follow these steps:

1. **Visit the Website**: Open your web browser and navigate to the URL where the website is hosted.

2. **Explore the Periodic Table**: Upon accessing the website, you will see the periodic table displayed on the screen. Each element is represented by its symbol, and elements are organized based on their atomic number.

3. **Navigate the Table**: To view elements, simply scroll through the table using your mouse or keyboard. Clicking on individual elements will not provide additional information, as this is a static representation.

4. **Use for Reference**: The website serves as a reference for studying the layout and organization of the periodic table. It can be valuable for students, teachers, and anyone interested in chemistry.

Feel free to explore the elements on the periodic table and use the website as a reference tool.
